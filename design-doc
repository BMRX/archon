Data generation idle game

Servers generate Data
Data generates Money
Money makes more Servers

SI Prefix used for compute speed

deca Hertz: Dhz  10
hecto Hertz: Hhz 100
Kilo Hertz: Khz  1000
Mega hertz: Mhz  1000000
Giga Hertz: Ghz  1000000000
Tera Hertz: Thz  1000000000000
Peta Hertz: Phz  1000000000000000
Exa Hertz: Ehz   1000000000000000000
Zetta Hertz: Zhz 1000000000000000000000
Yotta Hertz: Yhz 1000000000000000000000000

Compute Speed = Multiplier for Data generation
Clients = Multipler for Data sold

Tech = Autobuyer (employee lol)

# Notes
Make more efficient Servers, by increasing compute speed
Maybe some way to configure server layout, Server types?
Electricity bills?
Salary for techs?
Costs for server repairs?
Downtime?

Individual techs with varying skill level 
    Speed of repairs
    Trouble shooting speed
    
    Skills increase by "doing" 

    Techs can autobuy upgrades

Sell Data Center for X amount based on production

Server Object:
    cores: 1 (1 minimum)
    clock: 100 (not sure what the minimum is yet)
    busWidth: 8 (8, 16, 32 measured in bits)
    upgrade: 1 (multiplier for computeSpeed)

100 KHz = 200 Kbps (200 000 bits per second/25 Bytes per second)
or
1 : 2 ratio
source: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/56265/difference-between-hz-and-bps

8 bits = 1 byte

Measure everything in lowest value, convert to higher value for appearances (client side) this might not be efficient but until I find a better way, this is how it is


CPU Calculation
[Code Block] has a number of Instructions

CPU calculates that number of instructions

IPC = instructions per cycle, so then what is a cycle?

Example: A 4GHz CPU does 4 000 000 000 cycles per second

100 Hz = 100 instructions per second

bps = ipc * clock * bus * time
